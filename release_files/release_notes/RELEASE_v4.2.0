*  RELEASE NOTES Version 4.2.0
*  Date: November 26, 2013
*------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes over version 4.1.0:

* Support of multivalued attributes is added.  Attributes can be
  declared as multivalued and have a JSON array as their values in
  the data file. 

* Added a "facet=only" query parameter that tells the engine to return
  facet results only.  This feature can be used by a frontend that 
  wants to send a top-k query and a facet-query separately because of
  their performance differences.

* Added a parameter "f.field_name.rows" in a facet condition to define
  the number of categories with the maximal frequencies to be
  returned. All categories are returned by default. This parameter is
  only valid for categorial facets.  This feature can be used in
  a frontend where we want to retrieve a small number of facets.

* Added a control message API "resetLogger" to allow the user to use a
  third-party tool such as "logrotate" to manage the log file.

* GetAll search type is optimized for expensive queries. If the
  expected number of results is more than 10,000, the engine
  will return top 2000 results based on the ranking score.

* Optimization is done for short prefixes. If a query is a single
  prefix with an estimated number of records more than 50,000,
  the engine increases the performance by first computing the most
  likely completions, and then using them to compute top-k answers. 

* Optimized the process of returning JSON results.

* Tag names and attribute names are now case insensitive.

* Tag "queryTermType" is now changed to "queryTermPrefixType".

* Tag "queryTermMatchType" is now changed to "queryTermFuzzyType".
